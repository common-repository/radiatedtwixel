This is a very lightweight free Twitter widget by Radiated Pixel.

== Description ==

This is a very lightweight free Twitter widget. You can add as many widgets as you like and poll another users timeline on every widget. Sadly Twitter restricts unauthorized requests, so you can only view a random number of tweets (max. 5), starting with the latest. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Drag and drop the widget from the 'Widgets' menu to your sidebar(s).
4. Enter the Twitter username you want to display tweets from in the widget form.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why is it not possible to set an amount of loaded tweets? =

Twitter declines the request for tweets without authentication, so it's only possible to view a random amount of tweets. However, the latest tweet should always be shown.
